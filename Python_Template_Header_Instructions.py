# Standard imports  ### (Put here built-in libraries - https://docs.python.org/3/library/)


# Third party imports ### (Put here third-party libraries e.g. pandas, numpy)
import numpy as np # version 1.0.1


# Internal imports ### (Put here imports that are related to internal codes from the lab)


##### Please remove any patient/subject identifier from the code
##### Please use English (i.e. replace comments in Dutch or other languages)
##### Please include packages-libraries versions with a hashtag next to each of them (as numpy example above).
##### Please consider leaving a pip freeze requirements file in your projects folder so that we can keep track of all package versions used at the time the project was being executed. (https://blog.usejournal.com/why-and-how-to-make-a-requirements-txt-f329c685181e)
##### The comments in this file (e.g. ### Put here built-in..) do not need to be propagated to your code. They are only to give instructions in this template file.
##### Please consider using sections divisions such as the ones above enclosed by hashtags. 
##### Please also have a look at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. This will explain how to follow the Python community standards. E.g. i=i+1 is wrong, should be i = i + 1
##### Please consider limiting all lines to 72 characters (instructions on how to do that correctly can be found in PEP-0008 Maximum Line Length section).
##### Have a look at black.vercel.app (this is a browser link). This app will help you quickly format you code (basic formatting). Then you can proceed with manual enrichment.
##### Please document your functions to create docstrings (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). Example:

def function(args):
    """Short description.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    Argument1: what it should be, which format, example of file (if available)
    
    
    Examples
    ----------
    An example of how to use it, if necessary.

    
    Returns
    -------
    out: what is the output, in which format. 


    Notes
    ----------
    Details, if relevant. For example, function ignores NaNs or not.
